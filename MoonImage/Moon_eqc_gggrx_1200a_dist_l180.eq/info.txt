Abstract : This data product is a map of the gravity disturbances (in mGal) of the lunar gravity field at a resolution of 16 pix/deg by 16 pix/deg. It is based on a GRAIL gravity field of the Moon produced by NASA GSFC called GRGM1200A. GRGM1200A is a degree and order 1200 spherical harmonic model, which includes the entire mission of GRAIL tracking data. The disturbances are expanded in the spatial domain up to degree and order 180. Some details describing this model are: The spherical harmonic coefficients are fully normalized (geodesy 4pi normalized). The uncertainties are calibrated (the formal uncertainties multiplied by a factor of 1.635). The reference radius = 1738.0 km The gravitational parameter is GM = 4902.80011526323 km**3/s**2 The planetary ephemeris used is de430 and defines the lunar body-fixed coordinate system. A Kaula type power law constraint is applied to the spherical harmonics coefficients for degrees >600 (3.6e-4/n^2). The weighting of the KBRR data is: 0.03 microns/sec in the primary mission 0.05 microns/sec in the extended mission The weighting of the DSN data is: 0.12mm/s in both the primary and extended mission The nominal tidal Love number is k2 = 0.024133 +/- 0.000016 The current best reference for the GRGM1200A gravity field is LEMOINEETAL2014, published in the Geophysical Research Letters with the DOI number 10.1002/2014GL060027 . For additional details on the GRAIL mission, data and methods, see LEMOINEETAL2013. Each point gives the Lunar gravity disturbance in milligals, on a reference sphere with semi-major-axis = 1738.0 km, GM = 4902.80011526323 km**3/s**2, and zero rotation rate. As other lunar gravity fields, the map is expressed in the Moon Principal Axes frame, which slightly differs from the Moon Mean Earth frame. For comparison with lunar topography, users are advised to make use of the LOLA PDS products also archived in the Moon Principal Axes frame, such as the LDEM_64_PA product in the LRO-L-LOLA-4-GDR-V1.0 dataset, which can be accessed at the PDS Geosciences Node or at the LOLA PDS Data node. Note also that the reference radius for gravity (1738 km) and topography (1737.4 km) are different.
