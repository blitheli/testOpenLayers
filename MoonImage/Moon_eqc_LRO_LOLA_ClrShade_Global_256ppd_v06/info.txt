Abstract : This is version 6 of the LRO LOLA DEM ColorHillshade. This is a colorized shaded-relief of the original LOLA Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The DEM is a shape map (radius) of the Moon at a resolution of 256 pixels per degree, based on altimetry data acquired through Spetember 2011 by the LOLA instrument. The ground tracks were interpolated using the Generic Mapping Tools programs "surface" and "grdblend". The map is in the form of a binary table with one row for each 0.0039065 degree of latitude, pixel registered. Map values are referred to a radius of 1737400 m.
